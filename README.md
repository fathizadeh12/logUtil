# logUtil
Imagine there is a big project with thousands of lines of codes and many classes that a couple of programmers work on it.

Every one of that guys writes their own "inline loge" for their code. And it causes the log of code to be uncertain with a different styles.

We can prevent this problem by writing util for logging and use that instead of writing inline log.

This code just is an idea, not a best practice example. We can write more equipped and complete logger until for our projects.
